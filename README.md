# EverybodyThonk

**Plugin for PocketMine that make able all players to thonk all the time!**

When a player joins the server or changes his skin, EverybodyThonk replaces his original head by a new one : **a thonking head**. ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb4b157b06ba5c20f34699455d507c1334ec543e/68747470733a2f2f696d6167652e6e6f656c736861636b2e636f6d2f66696368696572732f323031382f33312f352f313533333330343230312d636170747572652d642d656372616e2d323031382d30382d30332d612d31352d34392d34312e706e67)

### What's *thonking*?
Well, it's the *thinking emoji*, but *thonking* is the meme of it. I can't be more specific. Google is your friend.

### What's possible with this plugin?
Actually, nothing. Soon, I'll add more options in a *config* like the possibility to : 
- change the thonking head's skin
- exclude a player from having the skin
- And many more!
